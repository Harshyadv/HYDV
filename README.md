A minimal, static “About Me” website built with Jekyll and Markdown.

The project focuses on simplicity, fast load times, and consistent rendering across modern browsers and mobile devices. Content is written in Markdown and injected into a lightweight HTML layout with minimal CSS.

Inspired by Jake Ginesin’s [site](https://github.com/JakeGinesin/jakegines.in), recreated from scratch with a reduced footprint and a black-and-white aesthetic.
