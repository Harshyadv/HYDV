# Hi, I'm Harsh.

I’m a **Computer Science Master’s graduate** interested in the overlap between **low-powered systems**, **machine learning**, and **visual design**.

I value clarity, efficiency, and software that communicates intent through both structure and aesthetics.

- **Here’s my resume:** [Download PDF](https://github.com/Harshyadv/Harshyadv/blob/369ad442dce60b007f4cb2b0775c2daea0f21166/Harsh%20Yadav.pdf)

### What I Care About
* **Systems & Workflow.** Fedora-first Linux setups, shell automation, resource-aware computing.
* **Design.** Pixel art, game icons, SVG editing, and minimal UI work that respects structure.

### Work & Projects
* **Icon & Logo Designer @ David Studio (Remote)**  
  Designed scalable icons and branding assets for an indie game in development using Figma & SVG.
* **Research Project**  
  *Comparative Study of QCNN and ResNet-50 for Medical Image Classification*  
  Explored accuracy, efficiency, and future scalability using TensorFlow, PyTorch, PennyLane, and Cirq.
* **The “HYDY” Site**  
  A minimal "**about me**" website recreated from scratch with a focus on structure over excess.
