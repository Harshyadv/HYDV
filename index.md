# Hi, I'm Harsh.

I am a **Computer Science Master’s Graduate** from Guru Ghasidas University with a passion for the intersection of **low-level systems** and **high-fidelity art**. 

Currently, I spend my time bridging the gap between technical engineering (AI/ML) and visual design (Pixel Art & UI/UX). I believe that software should not only be efficient but also aesthetically intentional.

### Focus Areas
* **Design.** Specialized in game icons, pixel art assets, and Figma prototyping.
* **Intelligence.** Exploring Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) and ResNet-50.
* **Environment.** Advanced Linux workflow (Fedora) and shell automation.
* **Security.** Interested in network integrity and secure systems architecture.

### Projects & Work
* **Icon Designer @ David Studio**: Led the visual identity for indie game assets.
* **Research**: Implementing deep learning models for image classification.
* **The "HYDY" Site**: A recreation of minimal web architecture built from scratch.
